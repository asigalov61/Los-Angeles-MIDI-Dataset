## [Los Angeles MIDI Dataset is now avaialable for download!!!](https://huggingface.co/datasets/projectlosangeles/Los-Angeles-MIDI-Dataset)

***
## Main Features:

### 1) ~240000 100% unique MIDIs to explore :)
### 2) Each MIDI file was read-checked and 100% de-duped
### 3) Extensive meta-data for each MIDI file
### 4) Detailed features matrix for each MIDI file
### 5) Helper Python code

***

## NEW in version 2.0

### 1) Quality over quantity: the dataset was reduced in half by triple-deduping (first by md5 hash, then by pitches sum, and then by pitches counts)
### 2) The dataset meta-data was extended to provide additional important info and to show more MIDI data
### 3) The dataset code/colab is now featuring super-fast MIDI searches (by pitches and by patches)
### 4) The dataset code/colab can now display and play each MIDI from the dataset
